In this activity, I am adding bootstrap components to my porfolio to ensure a responsive design for multiple platforms.

## Short descriptions of what I did
* Created the following pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

* A navbar

* A responsive layout

* Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.
